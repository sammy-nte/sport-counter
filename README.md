# sport-counter.
This project was created as part of scrimba's learn javascript course.
It had a simple design with just one page from the figa design file we were given.
I decided to complicate things and give it a whole new look to push my skills to the test.
There are two sections that will be coming soon thus, the football counter and tennis counter.
